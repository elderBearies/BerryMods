## Artifact of Gambling

The Artifact of Gambling is an artifact that adds more RNG to the game!
Whenever you pick up an item, there are four things that can happen:

* The item duplicates itself, causing another chance for all of these effects.
* Your stack count of that item doubles.
* You lose all stacks of that item.
* Nothing, you just pick up the item as normal.

I promise, this is more fun than it sounds.

Please note that this artifact applies to *all* inventories. That includes the monsters.

## Changelog

**1.0.0**

* Artifact of Gambling works!
