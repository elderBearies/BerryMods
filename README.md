Huge thanks to TheMysticSword#9770 for helping me learn hooks!

## Artifact of Gambling

The Artifact of Gambling is an artifact that adds more RNG to the game!
Whenever you pick up an item, there are four things that can happen:

* The item duplicates itself, causing another chance for all of these effects.
* Your stack count of that item doubles.
* You lose all stacks of that item.
* Nothing, you just pick up the item as normal.

I promise, this is more fun than it sounds.

Please note that this artifact applies to *all* inventories. That includes the monsters.

## Artifact of Jynxes

The Artifact of Jynxes is an artifact that gives you bad luck. Really bad luck. Like, three Puritys bad.
When you start a run with this artifact, your luck is set to -3. Clover and Purity can of course still raise and lower your luck as they normally would.
